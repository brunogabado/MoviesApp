This is a movie App with 3 pages.

Homepage - 
The page where we could find every movie present in the Database. 
Each movie is represented in the app by a card.
When clicked, the user is sent to the Movie Page
We have the possibility of searching by name every movie.

Movie Page -
This page appears when a card movie is clicked.
The page is just about the clicked movie, with all the information available.
We have a list of movies with the same director.

Profile Page - 
To get to this page, we need to log in or sign up.
This Page is identical to the Homepage, with all movie cards and the option to search.
The main difference is that we can create lists of movies. 
When a list is created, we can add or delete movies from it.
We can have more than one list, and the lists are saved in the database.

All this app, from the login and signup until the lists, was made with Xano who did the backend part for us.
